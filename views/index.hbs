                    <h2 class="lead">Hi, welcome to Wealthbuilder Budgeting!  Like many people, we have experienced the challenges of creating a budget when paychecks come at different intervals than the bills. The idea for this site came from the desire to have an easy way to enter a biweekly paycheck date and dollar amount. We wanted a place to list all expenses and income (including side jobs, extra income, etc.) and figure out how much money would need to be saved from each payperiod for the bills that are due once a month. 
                    The project has grown to multiple pay periods available, and allows you to look at how you tend to spend and save your money. The first thing to know if you want to grow your wealth is where your money is going right now. After you enter your expenses and see where you spend your money, you may want to evaluate how much more you could be saving or investing in wealth.</h2>
